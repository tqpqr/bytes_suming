# bytes_suming
Summing up the total space of disks archive (Sega Saturn in this case, but can be applied to various data archives from archive.org). Gets data from archive.org using Pandas and parses digits with regular expressions. The most interesting part is handling the units of information storage (saved here mainly to remember how it was implemented). Well commented.
